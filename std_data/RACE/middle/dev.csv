Sun-cookers have been used for centuries. A Swiss scientist made the first sun-cooker in 1777. Today, people are using sun-cookers in many countries around the world. People use them to cook food and to heat drinking water.
There are three kinds of sun-cookers. The first is a box cooker. It is designed with a special wall that collects sun-shine into the box. A box cooker is good for slow cooking of a lot of food.
The second kind of sun-cooker is a panel cooker. It has several flat walls that concentrate the sun-shine on the food. People can build panel cookers quickly. They do not cost much. In Kenya, for example, panel cookers cost just two dollars.
The third kind of sun-cooker is a parabolic cooker. It has rounded walls that concentrate sunlight into the bottom of the cooker. Food cooks quickly in parabolic cookers. However, these cookers are hard to make. They must be moved again and again to follow the sun. Parabolic cookers can also cause burns and eye injuries if they are not used correctly.
You can make sun-cookers from boxes or heavy paper. They will not catch fire. Paper burns at 232degC. A sun-cooker never gets hotter than that.

There are three kinds of sun-cookers. The first is a box cooker. It is designed with a special wall that collects sun-shine into the box. A box cooker is good for slow cooking of a lot of food.
The second kind of sun-cooker is a panel cooker. It has several flat walls that concentrate the sun-shine on the food. People can build panel cookers quickly. They do not cost much. In Kenya, for example, panel cookers cost just two dollars.
The third kind of sun-cooker is a parabolic cooker. It has rounded walls that concentrate sunlight into the bottom of the cooker. Food cooks quickly in parabolic cookers. However, these cookers are hard to make. They must be moved again and again to follow the sun. Parabolic cookers can also cause burns and eye injuries if they are not used correctly.

The following morning the expert again put the jade stone in the youth's hand and told him to hold it. On the third, fourth and fifth days, the expert asked the young man to do the same thing.

But travelling abroad now means much more than that for the growing number of Chinese tourists. Of course it offers us good opportunities to meet people from other countries, learn about their culture and customs.
According to the United Nations World Tourism Organization (UNWTO), more than 1 billion people travelled to another country in 2012. In 2012, Chinese people travelled abroad 30 percent more than in 2011. The prosperity   of the tourism industry can also bring both our country and foreign countries great economic benefits  . Chinese people usually join large tourist groups and visit several countries in one trip.
Chinese people don't just travel for sightseeing. The China International Travel Service Company said that all their tour trips sold out a month before Christmas Day. Stores offered discounts   during that time, so shopping in Europe and the United States is popular among Chinese travellers.
In December, China is going through a very cold winter. So many people like to go to some countries in Southeast Asia because the weather there is quite pleasant.
The improvement of living standards means more Chinese can travel abroad. But many of them don't have a sense of public manners. A report by Living Social website in March 2012 even listed Chinese as the world's second worst tourists.

Any mother or father understands the stomach problem is one of the most frequent  things their children complain about. Around twenty percent of children suffer from stomachaches that doctors cannot find a reason for.

As the capital of China, Beijing is a very beautiful city with fresh air and clean streets which make the travelers feel very pleased. To my surprise, many people there were learning English. Later I was told that they did so because Beijing would hold the 29th Olympic Games and they wanted most foreigners to understand them. They strictly kept the traffic rules. When there was a red light, no one was seen crossing the street.
Of all the places I visited, I liked the Summer Palace best. To our surprise, although it was winter when we were there, we still saw green trees and many fresh flowers. The whole park was very beautiful. We visited a very modern football field. We were told the buildings where the Olympic Games would be held were even better than that. I also enjoyed skiing in Xiangshan. Skiing is an interesting and exciting sport liked by many people.
In my eyes, China is a nice place and Chinese people are very kind. In Beijing Station, there were so many people, and most of them were going home to spend the Spring Festival--the most important Chinese festival, with their families. Passengers helped each other carry luggage , and they were very kind to foreigners. We were given a card by the hotel we stayed at, on which was the address of the hotel. With the card we never got lost in the city.

HFMD usually affects babies who are 1~4 years old, but adults can also be infected. Both EV71 and Cox A16 can cause HFMD, which usually starts with a slight fever followed by blisters   and ulcers   in the mouth and rashes   on the hands and feet.
It can be spread through people with the mucus   or feces   of an _ person. It usually appears during the summer and autumn months. HFMD isn't Bird Flu, SARS or Mad Cow Disease, but it's not a new one, either. It first appeared in New Zealand in 1957. About forty years later, it appears in Asia. It's reported that it breaks out every 2 or 3 years.
HFMD is very terrible and there is no vaccine   now, but we can do something helpful to prevent it. 'Children with HFMD should seek medical treatment as early as possible', experts say. They also suggest that parents keep the air fresh in a child's room, which should be kept clean, tidy and dry. Children should be taught to wash their hands regularly.

362,middle2756.txt,"Some inventions are so useful, but seem so simple, that we wonder why no one thought of them long ago. Post-it Notes, the pieces of paper that you can fasten almost anywhere and then remove without leaving any sign that they were there, are an example of such an invention.
Post-it Notes were invented about twenty years ago by Art Fry, a scientist at 3M Corporation. The idea for the product came from a frustrating experience he often had while singing in his church choir. Fry used pieces of paper as bookmarks to mark the places in his book of songs, but these bookmarks were always falling out. He knew he needed a bookmark that would stay where he put it, but that he could remove without damaging the pages.
Around that time, Fry heard about a new adhesive   that a workmate, Dr. Spence Silver, had created. This adhesive was special because it was sticky, but not too sticky. It was strong enough to hold papers together, but weak enough to not tear the paper when it was removed. Fry saw that the new adhesive could help solve his bookmark problem. One morning, Fry put some of the adhesive on the edge of a piece of paper. Just as he hoped, it made a perfect bookmark.
A short time later, Fry realized that his new invention had even more uses than being a great bookmark. He came to this realization when he wrote a note on one of his new ""bookmarks"" and attached it to a report he was going to give to a workmate. Soon, co-workers were asking Fry for more samples of his invention so that they could use the new type of notes themselves.
Fry and some other people at 3M believed so much in the new product that they persuaded the company to give away thousands of the ""sticky pieces of paper"" for trial use .

One of the coolest things about the sport of running is that you don't need expensive equipment . All you need is a good pair of running shoes and a safe environment. But just because you don't need much equipment don't be fooled into thinking the sport of running is easy. No one wakes up and decides to run a marathon without training.
Running makes your heart, lungs, and muscles stronger. It makes you know more about your body. Running also gives you energy by increasing your oxygen  intake, so you don't get sick easily. It can even help you keep your mind on school work because exercise helps you to think more clearly.
How do you take part in the sport if you don't know much about it? Most schools offer cross-country and track programs, but there are also running clubs open to all ages. A simple Internet search can help you find some in your area. The programs show you how running can offer competition or just be for fun. They also teach runners to set realistic goals and take care of their bodies.
Runners have great respect for each other because they know how difficult the sport can be. If you go to a race, you'll see people cheering for all the runners, from the first place finisher to the last place finisher. Running isn't always about how fast you are or how far you're going.

Now in the 21stcentury, advertising is more and more important for people. Why? I think it is because through advertising, people, especially the businessmen, can introduce their products to the people all over the world. Because of this, many companies spend a lot of money on advertising. As we all know, there are many advertisements which are very interesting and popular. For example, Michael Jordan made an interesting advertisement for Nike. From this you can see how the companies make their products known to the world.
People can make a lot of money through advertising. It is known that many famous singers and movie stars make money in this way. However, I don't think this is a good way for them to make money, because they are not the professional advertisers, especially those who advertise in medicine advertisements.

'All right then-just one more piece...' Words every girl has said when they are faced with the delicious cheesecake. Of course, many of us know we may eat the whole thing in the end.
It isn't just girls. Most of us find it hard to say 'no' to something attractive, However, scientists now say that willpower is very important to success and a happy life.
Scientists in different countries have been studying the effects of willpower on people's lives for a long time. The results are similar, according to an article on February 7 in the Guardian, a famous British newspaper.
In one experiment, scientists told young children that they could either have a marshmallow  now, or two marshmallows in 15 minutes. Waiting obviously needed more willpower. Scientists then continued studying the children as they grew up. They wanted to see if some children always had stronger willpower. They also wanted to see how having stronger willpower affected their lives.
Years later, scientists found that the children who had waited for two marshmallows were all healthier, happier and richer adults. Oppositely, the children who had shown weaker willpower at that young age were more likely to be in low-paid jobs, to be overweight, to have social problems.
But there is hope, Roy F Baumeister, an American social psychology  professor  told the Guardian. Baumeister says we can train our willpower just like we train our muscles.  Even a little practice can strengthen our overall self-control if we do it regularly.
You could start by making yourself stand up straight, speaking in complete sentences, or using a computer mouse with the other hand. Scientists have found that people who manage to change little habits often perform much better in laboratory willpower tests.
Like muscles, willpower can 'get tired'. Don't try to do too many things at the same time, or when you don't have enough energy, for example when you are ill.  If you already feel tired, you can try to recharge  your willpower with a good night's sleep and by eating well.",The example of a girl eating cheesecake is used to  _  .,prove that girls have weak willpower,introduce the topic of willpower to the readers,show that cheesecake is especially attractive to girls,show the connection between willpower and success,B

'All right then-just one more piece...' Words every girl has said when they are faced with the delicious cheesecake. Of course, many of us know we may eat the whole thing in the end.
It isn't just girls. Most of us find it hard to say 'no' to something attractive, However, scientists now say that willpower is very important to success and a happy life.
Scientists in different countries have been studying the effects of willpower on people's lives for a long time. The results are similar, according to an article on February 7 in the Guardian, a famous British newspaper.
In one experiment, scientists told young children that they could either have a marshmallow  now, or two marshmallows in 15 minutes. Waiting obviously needed more willpower. Scientists then continued studying the children as they grew up. They wanted to see if some children always had stronger willpower. They also wanted to see how having stronger willpower affected their lives.

406,middle2955.txt,"Since January 2013, many cities in China have seen a lot of foggy days. In Beijing, only five days in January _ smog  . What's the difference between fog and smog?
According to scientists, fog is made up of tiny   drops of water and also ice particles   during very cold conditions. Smog is dirty air that looks like a mixture of smoke and fog, caused mainly by smoke from cars and factories in cities.
An official for the Ministry of Environmental Protection told Beijing News that PM2.5 pollution is the main problem with air pollution. PM 2.5 refers to pollution with small particles 2.5 micrometers or less in diameter  .
According to the Chinese Academy of Sciences, two main factors that cause PM 2.5 are motor vehicles and the burning of coal.
Poor air has done harm to people's health. Children and the elderly are more at risk. A report from Beijing Children's Hospital shows that from January 5 to January 11, 2013, half of the patients in the hospital came for respiratory   problems.
To respond to the air problem, the Chinese government and many Chinese people have started to take action.
Beijing announced a plan to use clean fuel in government vehicles and plant trees. It asked citizens to set off fewer fireworks for the Spring Festival celebration. They suggested that cars with large emissions   should be banned and factories should be closely watched.
Three students from No. 4 High School in Beijing wrote a report to advise to fight the air pollution. ""We hope more people will join us to protect our environment. With all our efforts, the blue skies will certainly return soon,"" said Shi Yucong, 15, one of the three students.",What is the best title for the passage?,A report about air pollution,Let's fight the air pollution,Dirty air is bad for us,The air in Beijing,B

542,middle3728.txt,"When you visit Taiwan,Green Island is a wonderful place not to be missed.
Green Island,with clear blue water around it,is an island in the Pacific Ocean,33 kilometers east of Taitung. The old name for Green Island was Huoshandao,meaning ""fireburning island"". The island got its name because people on the island used to set up fires at night to help people who went fishing home.

Today, one of the most popular birthday traditions is to blow out the candles all at once to make a secret wish come true.
In order to please Artemis, the goddess of the moon, the ancient Greeks arranged something special for birthdays. A moon-shaped cake was baked and decorated with lit candles. They thought the smoke from the candles would carry an offering  up into the sky, where they believed Artemis lived.
The tradition of lighting birthday candles continued in Europe, where candles were sometimes kept burning all day on a person's birthday, partly as celebration and partly to keep away evil spirits.

709,middle4669.txt,"Do you believe that you aren't smarter than 3-year-old Alexis Martin, one of the youngest members of the high IQ club Mensa?
Preschooler   Alexis' IQ is 159, which is only one point lower than Stephen Hawking's. Doctors say the average IQ of a person is about 100.
She learned to read at the age of 2. She reads at a fifth grade level and has taught herself Spanish on her parents' iPad!
Now, she is a member of the Mensa Club, which only accepts people with an IQ within the top two per cent of people in the world!
Alexis' father, Ian Martin, said he first realized Alexis was special when she was 12 months old. She could recite   bedtime stories. ""We'd be driving around in the car and she would recite her bedtime stories from the night before. She didn't just recite them, and she recited them exactly.""
Alexis' father would try to trick her and say that her story went a different way, but she always corrected him.

Dear Editor,
Can't your newspaper do something about the habit if hitchhiking ?
On a recent car trip Icounted at least 50 people standing beside the road, asking for rides. Many of them were young girls.
Don't they understand how dangerous it is to get into a car driven by a stranger? What do they know about the driver's character or ability to drive? Nothing.
Many of the young hitchhikers probably come from good families. Don't their parents teach them anything about the world? I always teach my children not to talk to strangers. I never allow them to accept rides from people they didn't know.
Isn't there enough crime   today without asking for trouble by hitchhiking?

My stay in Thailand has certainly been the experience of my life. Life is busy and exciting.
Bangkok is just like any other big city with a population   of 10 million and heavy traffic.
I'm very lucky because my host family is in a nice quiet area outside the city. There are Mr and Mrs Phairat, their son Sanan, who is 18, the daughter Chinda, who is 16, and Grandpa and Grandma.
I go to an international school with Sanan and Chinda. The school teaches about 70 percent in English, and 30 percent in Thai. I've learned some spoken language, but Thai writing is very difficult. The cooking lesson is my favourite. I'm learning all about Thai food and culture. People don't use chopsticks   here, but spoons and forks.
Last weekend we drove to Pattaya Beach near Bangkok. I thought it was great, but Sanan and Chinda said that next month they were taking me to Phuket Island, where the beaches are even more beautiful. The month after next, we're going to travel to Mr Phairat's hometown in the north of Thailand. The Phairats own land there, and they have two elephants. I'm going to ride those elephants and even wash them.
I'm amazed by everything in this country, especially by the elephants. Elephants are an important part of Thai culture and way of life. They have been a traditional _ of Thailand for many years.

762,middle4966.txt,"Blind imitation   is self-destruction. To those who do not recognize their unique worth, imitation appears attractive: to those who know their strength, imitation is unacceptable.
In the early stages of skill or character development, imitation is helpful. When I first learned to cook, I used recipes   and turned out some tasty dishes. But soon I grew bored. Why follow someone else's way of cooking when I could create my own? Imitating role models is like using training wheels on a child's bicycle; they help you get going, but once you find your own balance, you fly faster and farther without relying on them.
In daily life, imitation can hurt us if we subconsciously   hold poor role models. If, as a child, you observed people whose lives were bad, you may have accepted their fear and pain as normal and gone on to follow what they did. If you do not make strong choices for yourself, you will get the results of the weak choices of others.
In the field of entertainment, our culture glorifies celebrities. Those stars look great on screen. But when they step off screen, their personal lives may be disastrous. If you are going to follow someone, focus on their talent, not their bad character or unacceptable behaviors.
Blessed is the person willing to act on their sudden desire to create something unique. Think of the movies, books, teachers, and friends that have affected you most deeply.

779,middle511.txt,"APRIL 5 marks the 100thanniversary of the sinking of the Titanic. In 1997, the movieTitanicwas a huge hit all around the world. Now, the 3-D version of the movie will come to Chinese theaters on April 10.
As anyone who has seen the movie knows, the Titanic struck an iceberg  and sank on its first _ in 1912, killing 1,517 people. A century after the accident, scientists have found something new to blame  for the sinking: the moon. Donald Olson, a Texas State University physicist, led a team of astronomers  to examine the moon's role, according to Reuters.
Normally, icebergs stay in place and cannot move until they melt enough or a high tide  frees them. A single iceberg can become stuck many times on its journey southward. The process can take several years.
According to Olson, a hundred years ago the moon made its closest approach to the Earth in more than 1,400 years. This caused the moon to have a much stronger pull on the Earth's oceans than usual, which created a super-high tide. The tide pushed icebergs from shallow waters off the coasts of Canada's provinces, Newfoundland and Labrador, into the Titanic's way.
""Of course, the final cause of the accident was that the ship struck an iceberg,"" Olson told Reuters. ""It went full speed into a region with icebergs, but thelunar connection  may explain how an unusually large number of icebergs got into the path of the Titanic.""
The research team will publish their research in the April issue of Sky & Telescope magazine.

804,middle5205.txt,"Do you know how it is when you see someone yawn   and you start yawning too? Or how hard it is to be among people laughing and not laugh yourself? Well, obviously it's because we have mirror neurons   in our brains.
Put simply, the presence of mirror neurons suggests that every time we see someone else do something, our brains model after it, whether or not we actually perform the same action. This explains a great deal about how we learn to smile, talk, walk, dance or play sports. But the idea goes further: mirror neurons not only appear to explain physical actions,they also tell us that there is a biological basis for the way we understand other people.
Mirror neurons can undoubtedly be found all over our brains,but especially in the areas which relate to our ability to use languages,and to understand how other people feel. Researchers have found that mirror neurons relate strongly to language. A group of researchers discovered that if they gave people sentences to listen to (for example: ""The hand took hold of the ball""), the same mirror neurons were _ as when the action was actually performed (in this example, actually taking hold of a ball).
Any problems with mirror neurons may well result in problems with behavior. Much research suggests that people with social and behavioral problems have mirror neurons which are not fully functioning  . However, it is not yet known exactly how these discoveries might help find treatments for social disorders.
Research into mirror neurons seems to provide us with ever more information about how humans behave, communicate and spend time together. Indeed, it may turn out to be nearly the same important thing for neuroscience as what Einstein's theory of relativity   was for physics.

807,middle5208.txt,"Stephen Hawkins was born in Oxford, England on 8thJanuary, 1942. He went to school in St. Albans--a small city near London. Although he did well, he was never top of his class. After leaving school, Hawking went first to Oxford University where he studied physics, then he went to Cambridge University where he studied cosmology. As he himself admits, he didn't work hard. He was a very lazy student, and did very little work. However, he still got good marks.
It was at the age of 20 that Hawking first noticed something was wrong with him. He started to bump  into things. When he visited his family at Christmas time, his mother was so worried that she made him see a doctor. Hawking was sent to hospital for tests. Finally, the result came back. Doctors said they had no way to help him. He would die before he was 23.
At first, Hawking became very sad, after a while, though, he began to see his life in a different way. As he later wrote, ""Before my illness was diagnosed , I had been very bored with life. There had not seemed to be anything worth doing. But shortly after I came out of hospital, I suddenly realized that there were a lot of worthwhile things I could do."" Hawking married, found a job at Cambridge University, and had three children. He also went on to do some of the most important scientific research.

The study involved fruit flies(g), as they share many genes  with humans. Researchers gave one group of fruit flies normal food, and another group of fruit flies got the same food including apple.
The results showed that flies that ate apple lived an average of 55 days longer than the flies that didn't eat apple. The study also found that apple-eating flies were more able to walk, climb and move about as they became old, the Journal of Agricultural and Food Chemistry reports.
The researchers believe that the antioxidants  found in apples are good for health.
In another experiment, researchers studied the diets of thousands of women. They found that those women who often ate apples were 20 percent less likely to have heart disease.
Scientists have recently discovered the apple's genetic code . This allows scientists to make new kinds of fruit that are healthier.

These are the roles moms and dads fall into when they become parents and it's common among all cultures. But times change and parents' roles seem to be changing,too. More women are bringing home food by having fulltime jobs and men are taking care of their children at home.
Chinese TV show Where Are We Going,Dad?provides a closer look at the changing roles of dads in modern family life. The show follows the adventures   of five celebrity   dads who take trips with their young children (aged 4 to 6) and try to complete a set of tasks. It shows how young dads are trying hard to find the best way to raise their children and keep a closer relationship with them. Young dads no longer want to be cold.
Psychologists   say that a strong fatherly influence is important in a child's development. Fathers teach their children skills and encourage them to try new things. They also give them a sense of safety. A child learns that if something goes wrong,he or she can depend on dad to help fix it. The psychologists also say that without a dad,a child is more possible to drop out of school and get into trouble.

A new report says more and more international students are attending colleges and universities in the United States. It also notes a large increase in the number of international students from China.
These findings are from the latest Open Doors Report. The report documents the record number of international students in the United States during 2012, 2013 school year. It says more than seven hundred sixty-four thousand four-hundred such students were attending American colleges and universities during the last two years. That represents an increase of almost six percent than one year earlier. On the other hand, the number of Americans studying overseas  increased by one percent, which reached nineteen thousand this year.
The report says one hundred ninety-four thousand students at American colleges and universities were from China .That is an increase of more than twenty-three percent over the year before. Peggy Blumenthal, an expert of international education, described the effect of the increase in Chinesestudents.
""Now they have been coming for some time. But this year was the highest level ever."" She says many Chinese families are able to pay for the highest-quality education for their children. The children mainly choose to study in America.
""We know many of them have enough income to be able to afford to send them anywhere in the world if they want to go. And for the most part, looking around the world, Chinese students still prefer to come to the United States as their choice.""
Chinese students are not the only ones who want to attend American colleges and universities. After China, India sends the second largest number of students to the United States for higher education. India has about one hundred thousand students in American schools. South Korea is third with about seventy-two thousand students.
Why do so many foreign students study in the United States? Peggy Blumenthal provides one reason.
""The advantage America has is that we have a huge system  and a very perfect system. So there are over four thousand universities and colleges in the United States. Among them are some top ones in the world, and what that tells us is there is still a lot of room to host international students.
Foreign students represent less than four percent of the total student population in American higher education. And from Learning English, that's the VOA Special English Education Report.

On the other hand, the number of Americans studying overseas  increased by one percent, which reached nineteen thousand this year.
The report says one hundred ninety-four thousand students at American colleges and universities were from China .That is an increase of more than twenty-three percent over the year before. Peggy Blumenthal, an expert of international education, described the effect of the increase in Chinesestudents.
""Now they have been coming for some time. But this year was the highest level ever."" She says many Chinese families are able to pay for the highest-quality education for their children. The children mainly choose to study in America.
""We know many of them have enough income to be able to afford to send them anywhere in the world if they want to go. And for the most part, looking around the world, Chinese students still prefer to come to the United States as their choice.""
Chinese students are not the only ones who want to attend American colleges and universities. After China, India sends the second largest number of students to the United States for higher education.

Why do so many foreign students study in the United States? Peggy Blumenthal provides one reason.

In 2006,Gurdon's work was developed by Yamanaka to show that a sample of a person's skin can be used to create stem cells. Using this technique, doctors can repair a patient's heart after a heart attack.
Luck favors the prepared mind Gurdon told the Nobel Prize Organization.

They performed in their first professional show when Fred was ten years old and Adele was twelve. Later, as teenagers, the two danced in many shows throughout the United States. Their first big success was on Broadway in 1917.
The Astaires -- as they were known --- became Broadway stars. However, in 1932, Adele Astaire married a British man, and stopped performing. But Fred did not give up his dream. He would go on alone, in the movies.
Fred said, ""Dancing is a sweaty job. You cannot just sit down and do it. You have to get up on your feet. It takes time to get a dance right, to create something memorable. I always try to get to know my dance so well that I do not have to think.""
In 1949, Fred Astaire won a special award for his film work from America's Motion Picture Academy. He also won awards from the television industry for a number of his television programs.[:ZXXK]
Fred stopped dancing in 1970. He was more than seventy years old at the time. He said a dancer could not continue dancing forever. He said he did not want to disappoint  anyone, even himself. He danced again in public only once after that. It was with another great male dancer, Gene Kelly, in the movie ""That's Entertainment, Part Two"".
Fred Astaire and his first wife, Phyllis, had three children. Phyllis died in 1954. Twenty-five years later, Fred married race horse rider Robyn Smith. Fred Astaire died on June 22, 1987.

The technology, designed by Russian company AR Door, was first tried out in May. When a customer walks into a ""fitting"" room, they'll stand in front of a big screen that looks like a mirror. A camera in the mirror, using Microsoft Kinect, monitors a customer's movement and projects a 3-D image of the clothes onto you while you stand before a screen.
The room also uses augmented reality technology. ""Augmented reality allows the customers to choose an item of clothing without having to try it on physically,"" the company told the Daily Mail.

One day late in the afternoon, while working to support his family, he heard a cry for help coming from a nearby pond .He dropped his tools and ran to the pond.

As we know, Emperor Yang loved Yangzhou very much. Throughout his life, he paid three visits to Yangzhou. On his first tour to Yangzhou, he stayed here for eight months. And the second time, he enjoyed an extravagant lifestyle in Yangzhou. He watched the song and dance shows all day and stayed in Yangzhou for nearly a year. The third time, he enjoyed himself drinking wine without planning to go back to the capital. It lasted for almost one and a half years. In the year AD 618, Emperor Yang was killed by his followers in one of his palaces in Yangzhou, and the Sui Dynasty ended.

1062,middle6708.txt,"Dear Alice,
I just received your letter. And I was very surprised to know that you decided to drop out of school and wanted to be a model .
Being a model for a living is not easy. In fact, a famous person like me has a lot of problems that you couldn't see. I can't eat what I like, even though I'm very hungry. Keeping thin makes me look more beautiful on the stage because no one would like to see a heavy model.
Besides, I have to wear a heavy coat in the hot sun, in a swimming suit in the cold air. And practicing walking nicely every day is tiring for me.
You might say I made much money from modeling. But my dear niece  , you have to know that money is nothing, knowledge is everything. School is important and everyone should go to school for a certain period of time. The longer they stay at school, the better they will be. Very often, I hope I can give up my job and continue my studies at school. But it is very difficult for me to go back to school again. I am too old to go back to school now.
You are a pretty young girl with a bright future. You only have one year to finish your studies in high school. A year is really short. Please do consider my words carefully before you decide. Of course, there is only one thing I care about, and that is your happiness.

""Here"" is a summer camp that's only an hour from New York City--but a world away. This camp is run by the Fresh Air Fund . Since 1877, the fund has helped poor children from New York City spend summers in the country. Each year, over one thousand children, age 6--18,take part in the program. Some stay at the camp; others live with host families. The fund pays all money.
The camp is for 8 to 15-year-olds. At camp, children can learn about the stars, see deer and cows and other animals, and go hiking, fishing, and of course swimming. The children learn responsibility  by helping out with chores like making beds and waiting on tables. They also learn a lot from teachers, who are often college students from around the United States and from other countries.
Host families from thirteen states and Canada offer to have children spend the summer with them. Many of these families have their own children. The visiting children become part of the family. They go with the family on picnics, to the pool or beach, and on trips. The children are from 6 to 12 years old when they make their first visit, and most are invited back.

1115,middle7012.txt,"Starting from this month, you won't be hearing the word ""NBA"" on sports programs on CCTV. Instead, sport hosts will give the full Chinese name when they refer to the NBA - National Basketball Association. You also won't hear any other English abbreviations on CCTV's Chinese programs, such as GDP (gross domestic product) or WTO (World Trade Organization). You will hear their Chinese translations.
CCTV received a notice from the State Administration of Radio, Film and Television, telling it to avoid using English-language abbreviations in their reports to protect the ""purity"" of the Chinese language. A few other TV stations also received the notice.
Fu Zhenguo, an editor of People's Daily, is one of the people who proposed the change. ""Using English in a Chinese-speaking environment is against Chinese law,"" he said. ""Using English on Chinese TV programs is unfair to people who don't understand English. It will have a bad language influence on kids and teenagers.""

Well, it's not as simple as you might think.
Blood is made up of different parts,such as red blood cells ,white blood cells and platelets .
Two chemical molecules on the red blood cells make people's blood different. Scientists mark one molecule ""A"" and the other molecules ""B"". According to which and how many molecules are on the red cell, scientists divide blood into four types: A, B, AB and O.
Scientists have been wondering if there are some links between people's blood types and their personalities, but they don't know for sure yet.
But some say that people with the same blood type may have things in common.
People with type A: They look peaceful from the outside. But they ask too much of themselves so that they may be very nervous inside. They get happy or sad easily. Sometimes they are shy but always very careful. They can easily win people's trust.
People with type B: They have strong minds. Once they start a task,they don't give up easily. They'll try their best to finish it and do it well. Type B people always try to make themselves different from others. They want to do things in their own way.
People with type AB: They are maybe the strangest among all blood types. They can be both open and shy,noisy and quiet at the same time. They are responsible and always ready to help others.

A millisecond is one thousandth of a second. People hardly notice such a small time difference, but it does cause them to stop searching, reported The New York Times. ""Without question, nobody likes to wait,"" said Arvind Jain, a Google engineer. ""Every millisecond matters.""
Nowadays, millions of smart-phones and computers are continually gathering and sending out information. With so many people downloading maps, sports videos, news and restaurant recommendations, you can get digital ""traffic jams"". Meanwhile, users are expecting faster and faster service.
Google found that if one website is 250 milliseconds slower than another website, then people will visit it less often. This is why technology companies are now competing to be the fastest. Google said people do expect different things from different websites because they realize not all loading times are the same. For example, a person will be more patient waiting for a video to load than for a search result.
Even so, four out of five online users will click away if a video takes too long to load. This makes it difficult for video websites to choose between the quality of pictures and fast loading times.

He runs away with his friends, Huck Finn and Joe, to an island in the middle of the Mississippi River for several days. With Huck he goes looking for treasure, with Becky he gets lost in a cave and finally they find a box of gold.
My favourite scene in the book is when everyone thinks Tom is dead. He decides to go to his town funeral. He hides and watches for a time and then suddenly he appears. Everyone is surprised to see him but they're also pleased to see him alive.
Tom is the hero of the story, but there are another important characters. Huck is an outsider and everyone is afraid of him . Becky is pretty with fair hair, Joe is Tom's best friend and Injun Joe is the bad man of the story.
The theme of the story is about children growing up. It describes how strangers are seen in small towns of America. Finally, it talks about freedom, social rules and how people are punished for bad behavior.
Why do I think The Adventure of Tom Sawyer is a great book? Mark Twain wrote the story in 1876, but it's still read and loved by people all over the world today. And although it's only a story.

Why do I think The Adventure of Tom Sawyer is a great book? Mark Twain wrote the story in 1876, but it's still read and loved by people all over the world today. And although it's only a story.

1151,middle7160.txt,"My favourite great book is The adventure of Tom Sawyer by Mark Twain. Tom lives with his aunt Polly in a quiet street of St. Petersburg, Missouri. He's a lively and clever young boy, and he finds himself in many exciting adventures . He runs away with his friends, Huck Finn and Joe, to an island in the middle of the Mississippi River for several days. With Huck he goes looking for treasure, with Becky he gets lost in a cave and finally they find a box of gold.
My favourite scene in the book is when everyone thinks Tom is dead. He decides to go to his town funeral. He hides and watches for a time and then suddenly he appears. Everyone is surprised to see him but they're also pleased to see him alive.

1153,middle7169.txt,"Getting electricity has always been a problem for the 173 people living in Nuevo Saposoa, a small village in Peru, South America. However, things went from bad to worse in March 2015 after heavy rains damaged the only power cables in the area. The villagers were forced to use oil lamps, which are not only expensive but also dangerous because of the harmful gases they produce.
Luckily, researchers at the University of Technology (UT) in Lima, Peru heard about their problem and found a wonderful solution. They made a lamp that can be powered by plants and soil, both of which can be easily found in the Amazonian rainforest where the village lies. The lamp takes energy from a plant growing in a wooden box and uses it to light up an LED light bulb.
While that may sound amazing and even impossible, the science behind the ides is quite simple. As plants create their food (using the sun's energy, water and chemicals from the soil), they also produce waste which they return to the soil. Tiny animals in the soil eat this waste and they produce electrons - the building blocks of electrical energy. The UT team put special sticks inside the soil to capture the energy and keep it in the lamp's batteries for later use. The researchers say a single charge can power a 50-watt Led light for two hours - enough time for local villagers to get their evening work done.
The university gave ten Plant Lamps to the villagers of Nuevo Saposoa in October 2015. So far, they have been a huge success!

1183,middle7234.txt,"There are many different kinds of disasters around the world. As an adult you know what to do during a disaster, but what about the children? Some adults think it would probably never happen to them, so they don't teach their children what to do. Before it's too late, here are ways to help you prepare your child for a disaster:
Educate: It is always good to let your child know about possible disasters. This doesn't mean children have to live in fear. When teaching them about disasters, keep the conversation positive by telling them there is a solution to the disaster. Keep the conversations short, allow for questions and answer honestly.
Prepare: Always be prepared, that is the best advice for children. For example, when preparing for bad weather, get the tools you need, like candles, radios, food, water and medicine. Teach your child what is needed in certain disasters so that they know what is available for them, if ever needed.
Plan: You should always have a plan for you and your child for any dangerous situation. Write out a simple list that they can read. The plan could start with ""listen to an adult's advice and/or call 119"".
Practice: Once you have got the correct safety tools and worked out the right plan, practice every few months. Practicing what to do during a disaster with your child will help them if the time comes.

Nobody has ever really seen cats and dogs falling from the sky, but there have been many reports of other strange things ""raining"" down.

1213,middle7443.txt,"This year the US will honour  one of the country's most famous writers--Mark Twain (1835-1910). Most readers know that his real name was Samuel Longhome Clemens, but how many know where the pen name ""Mark Twain"" came from?
The answer shows Clemens' colorful early life before he became a writer. ""Mark Twain"" was the cry shouted on a ship when the ship entered a part of a river that was two fathoms (6 feet) deep. ""Twain"" is an old-fashioned way of saying ""two"". Twain trained as a ship pilot on the Mississippi river for two years, a time that he wrote about in the humourousLife on the Mississippi (1883).
The famous river would become an important theme in many of his works--who could forget the journey of the Huck and Jim along it in his most famous book. The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn (1884)?
With little education, he had to teach himself how to write stories. Whenever possible, he would go to public libraries. There he spent much time reading and thinking, which greatly helped him with his writing.
On the other hand, his life experiences gave him wonderful material to write about and attract readers. Twain wrote in a style that has been called ""local colour"" because it shows great knowledge of local people and their customs.
This _ is very clear in the two books for which Twain is still celebrated today. The Adventures of Tom Sawyer (1876) and its follow-up The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn, which many people call ""The Great American Novel"".

1219,middle7444.txt,"Andrew Holleman, a 12-year-old boy,loved playing in the open land near his home.The land was wet and forested, and made a home for birds, other animals and many different plants.
It made the perfect place for him to study and get to know the nature. He had seen some red-tail hawks, red foxes, wood turtles and other animals. He also found special native flowers.
Suddenly it was announced that the ""empty"" land would be improved by a lot of houses on it. The plants would be removed, the animals would run away and most would probably die. Then the wet soil would be covered with extra grounds.
When he heard about the news, he was not happy. He was very worried that the land ans water would be polluted.
Andrew wrote down clearly all the research he had down about the area, and how the houses would affect the local environment. He sent letters to members of local government and television reporters. He also called on his neighbors to _ the building of the houses.
Although he was only 12 years old, he had the courage and wisdom of a person much older. Andrew' s teachers described him as gentle, shy and active. His classmates also admired how much he knew about local animals and plants,and the environment.Each day after school, Andrew went door-to-door, to ask the people to sign, who did not want the houses to be built. In only one month, he got the signatures of 250 people.

Choose to learn English in a language school near your homestay where you
live ;
Have your English classes in the house with a member of family who is a qualified    teacher;
Don't have any classes at all when you visit a foreign country-a popular
choice if you want to be a tourist for example.
Even in the busy summer period the organization that provides the homestays will always try to place you with the most suitable  host family to meet your needs. With the help of the organizations, you don't worry about where you live, your interests, your language level, eating habits, medical care and anything else you may have during the homestay.
Though the price of homestay is,mainly depended on your needs, high-quality homestay accommodation can be relatively economical . And if you want your homestay in or near the city center, you may pay for an extra amount of money. Even if you stay further out. you can expect your journey into the center not to Go beyond 30 minutes.
Not only does homestay accommodation represent  value for money,it also gives you an excellent opportunity to practice the foreign language with your host family. This is a very important extra for students who like to speak as much language as possible. But if you plan to learn English. Why not have your English classes in your host family? There's no better way to learn languages than this because it makes learning and accommodation together as well as the cultural experience!",What's the passage mainly about?,It introduces famous places of interest around the world.,It tells us why homestay has been popular in the world.,It gives us advice on how to learn foreign languages well.,It describes how homestay works between different countries.,B

Such electronic products make the brain more active, and then influence their sleep. But according to a latest survey, more than 90% of Americans regularly use a computer or some other kinds of electronic products in the hour before bed.
Researchers are finding that man-made light from some electronic products at night may reduce the brain chemicals  that help sleep. The researchers showed that sitting in the light from computer tablets clearly lowered levels of the chemical which manages our body clocks and plays a role in the sleep cycle.
In the study, the researchers let volunteers read, play games and watch movies on a tablet for different time while measuring  how much light their eyes received. They found that two hours of sitting before a bright tablet screen at night reduced the sleep chemical levels by about 22%.
Studies of students using computers at night have got the similar results. And researchers say _ may not only cause sleeplessness, but also raise the risk of obesity , diabetes  and other diseases.
To be on the safe side, the researchers advise us to use computers less before bed, or at the very least turning down your screen as much as possible.

Researchers are finding that man-made light from some electronic products at night may reduce the brain chemicals  that help sleep. The researchers showed that sitting in the light from computer tablets clearly lowered levels of the chemical which manages our body clocks and plays a role in the sleep cycle.
In the study, the researchers let volunteers read, play games and watch movies on a tablet for different time while measuring  how much light their eyes received. They found that two hours of sitting before a bright tablet screen at night reduced the sleep chemical levels by about 22%.
Studies of students using computers at night have got the similar results. And researchers say _ may not only cause sleeplessness, but also raise the risk of obesity , diabetes  and other diseases.
To be on the safe side, the researchers advise us to use computers less before bed, or at the very least turning down your screen as much as possible.

Scientists from Budapest, Hungary, studied 400 university students. In the study, the students need to finish a questionnaire .

From the questionnaire, scientists found that the students always answered something like ""My mood often changes for no reason.""and ""I love to deal with new projects, even if it is risky.""These answers were then matched with their birthdays.

Fill a glass with water and add a bright colour of food colouring . Then place a long stemmed white carnation  in the coloured glass of water. Each day. Watch as the white carnation changes into the same colour as the food colouring. Children can see that plants drink water and where the water goes, and this is a favourite Earth Day activity for kids.
Leaf collection
This Earth Day project is fun and easy to do. First, take a walk in the field and children can collect lots of leaves. When collection is complete, kids can place the leaves in between two pages of white paper and then put them together to make a leaf book.
Feed the birds
Here you will find an exciting Earth Day activity that helps animals, especially birds. Find or purchase a large pinecone . Cover the pinecone with butter and bread. Hang the homemade bird feeder on a tree near a window and watch the birds come to have their dinner.
Clean the park
There are many organized events in towns and cities for clean-up activities on Earth Day. But if one is not offered in your town or city, you can do some clean-up just by yourself in the local park. A huge clean-up is not necessary; a little help goes a long way and the idea is to show kids that keeping public areas clean is everyone's business.",What's the passage mainly about?,Some Earth Day activities for children.,Some knowledge children should know.,How to protect our nature.,How to learn with our children.,A

Don't worry. If you get a flu vaccine  , it can stop you from getting the virus  . Flu vaccines work by giving the body a small amount of flu viruses. This causes your body to develop antibodies  . So next time you get the flu, the antibodies should help you.
The flu virus changes every few years. Therefore, there are so many types of flu, such as H1N1 and H5N1. The antibodies for one type of flu can't help us against all types of flu. That's why we need to get the vaccine every year.
However, good health habits may also help stop you developing a cold or flu. Washing your hands often helps stop you from getting viruses. It is also important to get regular exercise and eat healthy food. All these can help you strengthen your immune system  .",The following ways can help stop the flu EXCEPT    _   .,staying indoors,getting regular exercise,eating healthy food,washing our hands often,A

One evening, Brownie's family noticed that their dog hadn't returned home. They went looking for him, but with no success. Brownie didn't show up the next day, and by the next week he was still missing.
Curiously, Spotty showed up at Brownie's house alone. He barked loudly. But busy with their own lives, Brownie's family just ignored   their neighbor's nervous little dog.
Finally, one morning Spotty refused to take ""no"" for an answer. He followed Ted, Brownie's owner, everywhere he went. He barked, then rushed towards a nearby empty lot and back, as if to say, "" Follow me!""

First, I think an interest in English is very important. When I was in Grade One, we had a new subject - English. It was fresh for me . I was interested in it, so I worked hard at it. Soon we had an English exam and I got a very good mark. How happy I was! After that, I learned English harder and harder. Our English teacher often teaches us English songs, the songs sound nice. I often think how interesting English is!
Second, I think English is a foreign language. I should learn it well in the following ways: Listen to the teacher carefully, speak bravely, read aloud and have a good vocabulary . Then practice again and again, never be tired. And I also have a good habit: Asking whenever I have a question, I must make it clear by asking our English teacher. How happy I am when I understand!
Besides this, I often read English stories, jokes and easy novels. From these I know English is not only interesting, but also useful. They help me understand a lot of things. So to do more reading is an important way to learn English well.
And I also do some exercises from our class magazines, and I often write English diaries. English has become a close friend of mine.
Now I have learned English for more than two years. I always keep the first position in our school. From these words, I hope every student can learn English well.",Which of the following is not the way the writer studies by?,speaking bravely,Writing to foreign friends,Reading aloud,Writing English diaries,B

1381,middle886.txt,"Take a look at the label  on almost any bottle of milk and you may see the word PASTEURIZED. What does that mean? Let's find out by meeting Louis Pasteur.
Louis Pasteur was born in 1822 in a little town in France. As he grew up, he loved to paint. He loved to look at the world around him. When he went to college in Paris, he showed interest in looking through a microscope. A microscope makes things look a lot bigger; it lets you see things you can't see just with your eyes. Looking through a microscope, Pasteur found a living world in a drop of water. He saw and drew pictures of the small living things -- he called them ""microbes"" or ""germs""-- that crowded in a drop of water.
One day a winemaker came into the lab, hoping that someone could help him with his problem. ""Sometimes my wine tastes delicious, but sometimes terrible,"" he said to Pasteur. ""Can you help me find out why?""
Pasteur put some drops of the wine under the microscope. He noticed that the terrible wine had some unusual germs. If he killed these germs, maybe he could keep the wine from turning terrible. He tried with different ways to kill the germs. In the end he found heating   the wine seemed to work best. The winemaker tried it, and every bottle of wine tasted good.
Pasteur's idea worked for other people, too. When farmers heated milk, it didn't turn bad so quickly. When breweries heated beer, it tasted better. People called it ""pasteurization"" ---heating a liquid to kill bad germs. Aren't you glad that the milk you drink has been pasteurized?",What do you think Louis Pasteur was like from the passage?,"Clever, helpful and hard-working.","Quiet, helpful and kind-hearted.","Brave, careful and hard-working.","Clever, serious and kind-hearted.",A
